# Bikesharing

## Overview of Analysis
Work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company.

For this analysis I was asked to use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
- Add these new visualizations to two I created in this module for a final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors. 

## Results
The overall results can be found using the following [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_16386004193120/NYCCitiBikeRiderAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Summary
Analysis of the information that there was no significant change between genders and the way they use the Citibike. Overall men used the bikes more often. When comparing types of users, I found that people who were subscribers tended to use the service more during the weekdays and people who did not have a subscription used the service more during the weekend. Subscribers were also found to use the bikes more during peak commuting times (8 am and 5-6pm). Non-subscribers were found to use the bikes during late afternoon to even hours (2-6 pm). Further analysis could be conducted to find out if subscribers specifically use the service to commute to work. Data would need to be collected on customers repeated routes to find if they are the same to find a pattern of commute. If so, more branding/advertising could be created to market to local companies and inform other about Citibike opportunites with local companies. 

Further research could also be conducted to determine if service is lessened due to geographical issues such as hills that people would be less inclined to bike over. Possiblity of electric bikes may be a more desired option in these areas or areas that require longer commutes.
